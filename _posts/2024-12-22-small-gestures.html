excerpt: "Volunteering in a busy hospital has shown me the power of small gestures. Whether helping with directions or comforting someone, kindness is transformative. In business, we can apply this attitude to build meaningful connections, stay positive, and succeed. Let’s embrace random acts of kindness every day."

<p>One day a week, I volunteer as a customer service representative at a large hospital that serves over 340 patients daily. It is an incredibly busy environment, and although my roles seem basic, they are profoundly significant.</p>

  <h3>It’s Magic</h3>

<p>I deeply respect and admire the nurses, doctors, and other hospital staff. They do incredible work every day.

During my four-hour shift, I help people with everything from simple questions, like:</p>

<ul>
    <li>“Where is the cafeteria?”</li>
    <li>“Where is the nearest bathroom?”</li>       
    <li>“Where is the ATM?”</li>
</ul>    

<p>to more complex situations, like:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Consoling someone who has just lost a loved one.</li>
    <li>Helping a confused visitor navigate their next steps in a sprawling hospital.</li>
    <li>Calming frustrating patients or family members.</li>
</ul>    

<p>But beyond that, one interaction stands out as the one I enjoy most. It touches my heart and leaves me feeling humbled and warm inside. These moments are indescribably rewarding, engaging, and gratifying.</p>

<p>They feel like magic.</p>

<p>It is kindness in its purest, most random form.</p>

<h3>Enchanted</h3>

<p>At one point, I realized something important. We all have the ability to bring magic into the world. Each of us holds a special power.</p>

<p>In business, we can carry the same attitude of kindness and positivism into our professional lives. Too often, people rush, lose patience, or—most frustratingly—become indifferent to the simple joys and graces of being kind and available.</p>

<h3>Broken Record</h3>

<p>It frustrates me endlessly when people neglect basic civility. Kindness should not be an exception, yet it often feels like a broken record:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Failing to say “thank you.”</li>
    <li>Being so engrossed in social media that we miss what is happening around us—and the opportunities to connect with others.</li>
    <li>Ignoring people because we can’t spare the time or effort to engage.</li>
</ul>    

<p>And on it goes.</p>

<h3>“Little Things”</h3>

<p>Treating everyone with respect and care, whether in professional settings or personal interactions, is crucial.

I urge us all—including myself—to notice and appreciate the “little things” around us, like:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Buying someone a cup of coffee just because.</li>
    <li>Respecting other people’s time and priorities.</li>
    <li>Greeting everyone with cheerfulness and friendliness, every time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is it difficult? Certainly. But each of us has the opportunity—and the responsibility—to try. That effort is one of the keys to true success.</p>

<h3>Genteel, Simple as That</h3>

<p>Here is the plan for all of us, myself included:  Even if it means changing our style, approach, or attitude. We should commit to practicing small acts of random kindness.</p>

<p>Starting tomorrow, let us be a little more genteel.</p>

<p>Simple as that.</p>
